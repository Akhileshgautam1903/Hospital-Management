# Hospital Management System

Welcome to the Hospital Management System project! This ASP.NET Core MVC application aims to simplify the process of managing appointments for both users and administrators (doctors). The system consists of two main modules - User and Doctor (Admin). Users can book appointments with their preferred doctors and view their allocated time slots. On the other hand, administrators can add new doctors, specify their timings, and manage appointments.
